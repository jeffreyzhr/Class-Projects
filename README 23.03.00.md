# Class-Projects
Notable projects from classes I've taken at UC Berkeley :)

These include:

• Gitlet - a version control system similar to Git

• Classify - a Machine Learning image classification program written in RISC-V assembly

• PacMan - an artificial intelligent PacMan that uses search algorithms and reinforcement learning

• Snake - a playable Snake game written in the C programming language
